Group Reflection

What worked well in the group?

GitHub was a real godsend. The ability to quickly upload files to a single repository where all team members can access the relevant information was fantastic. I can really see now just how beneficial this software is in the workplace.

Our team communicated pretty well through Microsoft Teams; we had multiple group meetings to discuss our progress and to decide what we should work on next.

What could be improved?

I think communication is something that can always be improved. We managed well, considering we live in different time zones, and have busy work lives, and are studying multiple subjects.

Our communication was reasonably good, but more continual contact (checking in daily) would make it even better.

What was one surprising thing about working in a group?

I found that everyone worked really well together, despite having only known each other for such a short period of time. Even though we never met in person, we were able to work on and complete various aspects of the assignment.

What is one aspect we have learned about group work?

Regular communication is essential. Everyone in the team has a busy life, including work and personal commitments. We successfully worked around each other's schedules, despite the differences in time zones, and were able to work toward completing the assignment, step by step.
