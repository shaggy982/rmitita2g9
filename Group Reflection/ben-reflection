What worked well in the group?
I believe the use of tools such as Microsoft Teams and GitHub made the sharing and critiquing of the content for the report a lot easier, in turn making us far more efficient in completing tasks.

What could be improved on?
To be able to succeed in a group environment communication is key. When we were communicating frequently tasks were a lot easier to manage, in the instances where communication was lacking it was harder to express and share ideas.


What was one surprising thing about working in a group?
One surprising thing for me was how well we all got along given the fact that we had never actually met in person given that we are all around Australia.
