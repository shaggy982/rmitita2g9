What worked well in the group?

I believe the use of tools such as Microsoft Teams and GitHub made the sharing and critiquing of the content for the report a lot easier, in turn making us far more efficient in completing tasks. When these tools are utilised effectively by all members of the group the sharing, editing, and organising of files became much easier to manage therefore making the ability to organise the document much easier.

What could be improved on?
To be able to succeed in a group environment communication is key. When we were communicating frequently tasks were a lot easier to manage, in the instances where communication was lacking it was harder to express and share ideas. When communication broke down and updates were not provided it put a lot of strain onto the members of the group who were trying to progress with the assignment. Those who were actively communicating were able to navigate the issues of members not involving themselves.

What was one surprising thing about working in a group?

One surprising thing for me was how well we all received each other at first. The thought of the group projects worried me int the beginning, due to the location of everybody and different time zones I was worried that collaborating would be challenging. Although there were some communication issues among the group throughout the assignment the ability to complete group work was shown to be easy as the tools available to us made the fact that we are all over Australia a non-issue in completing tasks. In a situation where everybody is utilising the tools available to them effectively, group work can be a very fulfilling endeavour.
