Group Reflection

End of week 6 I think we should all fill this out, should have an idea by then of what we think, I can then take what we each have put and make it into a couple of paragraphs for the end of the report.
10 marks so a good chance to get some easy marks in without a heap of effort.

What worked well in the group?

Ben- I believe the use of tools such as Microsoft Teams and GitHub made the sharing and critiquing of the content for the report a lot easier, in turn making us far more efficient in completing tasks.

What could be improved on?
Ben- To be able to succeed in a group environment communication is key. When we were communicating frequently tasks were a lot easier to manage, in the instances where communication was lacking it was harder to express and share ideas.

What was one surprising thing about working in a group?

Ben- One surprising thing for me was how well we all got along given the fact that we had never actually met in person given that we are all around Australia.

What is one aspect we have learned about group work?
(I reckon we pick one and just harp on it for a paragraph. 
i.e. working around otherâ€™s schedules, the necessity to maintain a constant stream of communication, utilising a repository or teams type situation to exchange files, 
or even that a friendly demeanour and attitude towards each other helps with achieving goals.)
