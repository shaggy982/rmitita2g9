Team Profile

Each of you will have produced a personal profile for Assignment 1. You are to assemble this information, reviewing it as you see fit given your feedback from Assignment 1, to produce a team profile. This should be organised into the following subsections.

*****Team Name - Future Innovators
Personal Info - one paragraph - includes name, student number, background, hobbies, IT interest and IT experience. Includes your team's chosen name?

*****Team profile - test outcomes for each person in the team - all 3 tests - and our understanding of how this info may be helpful to the group.

*****Ideal jobs - compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from A1.

What comment elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?

*****Tools - Setup group website & group GitHub. This facilitates production and maintenance of group artefacts, including assignment submission. May also include other reports or info, code, examples, data, images, videos, links, etc.

Also need to include a report with a brief description of what has been done and including - link to group's website - link to group's repo - comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repo reflect the group's work. The latter task about comments should be done closer to the time of submission.
