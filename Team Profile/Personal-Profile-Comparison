Personalities

Among our group we have a variety of personality types, with the information available about these personality types we can ascertain how we may operate as a group collective.
We have leader types to propel the group forward and keep communication open, a support type to offer assistance to group members who may be struggling and keep us on track, an assertive logistician type to create and maintain a direct plan of action, and a virtuoso type who will be willing to explore ideas and concepts other may not be so quick to identify.


Learning Types

We have a variety of learning types in our group also, this will be extremely beneficial in the sense that we will be able to assist each other on topics of study. If somebody in the group is unable to grasp a concept due to the manner in which it is presented the chance of others being able to explain it is far greater than if we all possessed the same learning style.


Inividual Tests

The results of the separate tests that were undertaken by us all is a good insight to what we each can bring to the group outside of the standard learning conventions. Whether it be high situational awareness or and openness to delve into all aspects of working as a team, they show that we can each offer a unique trait to this group environment.
