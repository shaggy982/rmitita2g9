Job title: Front End Web Developer
Rank: 6th

Skillset
    IT-specific: Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, jQuery, SQL
    General: communication, organisation, problem solving, team work, meeting deadlines

High demand for Javascript (#2) and SQL (#1). Low-moderate demand for Website Production (#15), Full Stack Developer (#17), PHP Developer (#24).

High demand for communication (#1), organisation (#3), problem solving (#2) and team work skills (#5). Lower demand for meeting deadlines (#16).

Three IT skills not in my skillset:
SQL (#1), Java (#5), Microsoft C# (#6)

Three general skills not in my skillset:
Writing (#3), Research (#11) Leadership (#12)

After reading this information, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed; but, I would like to become more competent in SQL, Java and C# to have more job opportunies available.

Java and C# are used in software engineering roles, and competency in both of these would make my skills more appealing to a company hiring for such a role. SQL is very popular due to the foundational need for databases in every online IT solution; I would definitely like to add this to my list of skills.
