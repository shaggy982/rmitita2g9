Group Reflection

End of week 6 I think we should all fill this out, should have an idea by then of what we think, I can then take what we each have put and make it into a couple of paragraphs for the end of the report.
10 marks so a good chance to get some easy marks in without a heap of effort.

What is one aspect we have learned about group work?
(I reckon we pick one and just harp on it for a paragraph. 
i.e. working around otherâ€™s schedules, the necessity to maintain a constant stream of communication, utilising a repository or teams type situation to exchange files, 
or even that a friendly demeanour and attitude towards each other helps with achieving goals.)
